      <h2>First</h2>
      <h3>Quit More Books</h3>
      <h4>written by JAMES CLEAR</h4>
      <h5>PRODUCTIVITY SELF-IMPROVEMENT</h5>
      <p>It doesn’t take long to figure out if something is worth reading. Skilled writing and high-quality ideas stick out.

        As a result, most people should probably start more books than they do. This doesn’t mean you need to read each book page-by-page. You can skim the table of contents, chapter titles, and subheadings. Pick an interesting section and dive in for a few pages. Maybe flip through the book and glance at any bolded points or tables. In ten minutes, you’ll have a reasonable idea of how good it is.
        
        Then comes the crucial step: Quit books quickly and without guilt or shame.
        
        Life is too short to waste it on average books. The opportunity cost is too high. There are so many amazing things to read. I think Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, put it nicely when he said, “Life is too short to not read the very best book you know of right now.”</p>
